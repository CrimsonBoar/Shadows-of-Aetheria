## Overview

Baufendom is the beating heart of Aetheria, a land of rolling grassy plains, verdant forests, hilltops and sacred groves. Once the core of the old kingdom, it rose from the ashes of the Great Sundering to become a cultural and political centre for much of the continent. Today, it is regarded as the most “civilised” and stable of the five realms.

### Geography

- **Landscape**: Sweeping plains broken by fertile farmland, dense greenwood forests, and winding rivers.
    
- **Climate**: Mild and temperate, with warm summers and cool winters — ideal for farming and settlement.
    
## Capital: [[New Solmara\|New Solmara]]

- Founded after the destruction of **Old Solmara** during the Great Sundering.
    
- Built to symbolise resilience and unity.

## Politics

- **Baufen Council**: A body of nobles, merchants, and priests who assist King Sargolor in governing New Solmara and oversee law across the plains.
    
- **Local Rule**: Villages and towns often answer to regional lords but enjoy a good deal of independence.
    
- **Foreign Relations**: Seen as the “stewards of Aetheria,” Baufendom seeks alliances with other realms, though tensions with [[Eid Glacia\|Eid Glacia]] and the [[Aegaeon Archipelago\|Aegaeon Archipelago]] occasionally flare.
## Economy

- **Strengths**: Agriculture, lumber, and trade. The plains provide grain and livestock, while the forests provide timber and herbs.
    
- **Trade Hubs**: New Solmara serves as a crossroads for merchants across Aetheria.
    
- **Guilds**: The **[[Locations/Places/Adventurers’ Guild\|Adventurers’ Guild]]** has one of its largest and oldest halls here, drawing hopefuls from every region.
