The **Adventurers’ Guild** is the largest and most influential guild in all of **Aetheria**. Founded shortly after the [[History/Great Sundering\|Great Sundering]] and the unification of the Five Regions by [[Kaelmund Ironheart\|Kaelmund Ironheart]], the Guild was created to provide structure, opportunity, and recognition to those who risk their lives to defend the land and seek fortune.

With guild halls established in every major city and smaller branches even in frontier towns, the Adventurers’ Guild serves as both a hub for contracts and a refuge for weary adventurers.

Membership in the Adventurers’ Guild grants access to official quests; tasks sponsored by nobles, townsfolk, merchants, or even the Guild itself. Adventurers are ranked by **tiers**, which determine the difficulty of quests they may accept, the resources available to them, and their responsibilities within the Guild.

The Guild emphasises both **merit** and **honour**: climbing through the ranks requires completing quests, proving one’s skill, and demonstrating reliability.
