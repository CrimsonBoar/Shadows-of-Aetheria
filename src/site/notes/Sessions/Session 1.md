[[PCs/Kyocera Cloud\|Kyocera Cloud]] wakes up in a prison cell after being captured by slave traffickers, banging on the bars to get attention in a mixture of lostness and confusion, with nothing but beige, sack-like clothes that stretch as they try to fit his body. The cell is approximately 6 feet by 6 feet and 10 feet tall. The floor is a rough stone; the walls, apart from the iron bars holding him in, are of the same stone material. The air is damp, and in front of the cell, he sees lines of cells, three on each side, leading down a corridor to steps meeting a wooden door.

*(investigation roll 8)* Behind bars, he hears the shouting of people in the background.

*(strength roll 15)* Kyocera sizes up the cell door, giving it a big, forceful punch. In turn, the whole wall of iron bars comes off and falls to the floor. No guards arrive after hearing the sound.

Kyocera walks up the stairs at the end of the hallway, goes through the door, and enters a well-lit room with walls similar to those lining the cell. The room looked to be around 15 by 15 feet, about 10 feet in height. A wooden door meets the front of the room, before it, tables and chairs.

*(investigation roll 4)* Kyocera sees that it is a normal wooden door.

*(strength roll 20)* Kyocera does a round-house kick to the door, shattering it into a million pieces.

Outside, he sees crowds of people of all kinds and ages; he sees kids running and laughing, stalls lining the streets. The sound of cheer and market vendors advertising their goods, A festival is underway. Kyocera walks in amongst the crowd.

[[PCs/Aurelius\|Aurelius]] arrives in Brindlebrook, and he is going around looking at all the stalls; today is the [[Buafen Harvest Festival\|Buafen Harvest Festival]] after all. He walks towards the nearest stall, the sign on top has a cauldron with an apple. Similarly, inside the stall are lines of cauldrons filled with water and apples; the store owner standing among them is a pale young man with short brown hair.

Aurelius asks the stall owner about the contents of the stall. In response, the owner tells him that it is an apple bobbing contest, where you have to submerge your face in the cauldron and pick up an apple with your mouth, and you win a prize. Aurelius asks for a demonstration, to which the owner was compliant. As the store owner has his head under the water, Aurelius scans the stall and sees a small wooden box under the stall table.

*(investigation roll 15)* Aurelius investigates the box; in it, he sees 10gp. 

*(sleight of hand roll 2)* Aurelius tries to swipe 2gp from the box. Just as he touches it, the owner pops his head up from the cauldron, apple in mouth and spots him rummaging around in the money box. The owner calls out, "GUARDS! HE"S TRYING TO STEAL MY MONEY".

*(deception roll 11)* Aurelius says to the owner that he was pushed by the ground and merely bumped into the box of gold. With hesitation, the owner lets him off with a warning, telling him that if he ever comes back, he will call the guards.

Aurelius apologises to the store owner and starts walking down the street to the other markets. "Be gone, tiefling!" follows behind him as he goes and stares down the owner one last time before dispersing into the crowd.

[[PCs/Thorm\|Thorm]] is at the festival, looking through and recording it all in his journal. He hears stall vendors shouting "pie eating contest! gather round gather round!", another one shouting "grease pig chase! grease pig chase!", another preaching about goods and trinkets. Thorm takes an interest and makes his way to the pie-eating contest; the stall is small with a banner over the top with a nice steaming pie, to the right, a long table filled with pies sitting atop a stage-like platform. The owner is a man in his mid-40s with short, greying hair, a moustache covering his face. Thorm asks about the contents of the pies, as well as the winnings. In response, the owner tells him that the pies are apple, and the winnings are 10gp. Thorm signs up and makes his way to the stage. Sitting beside him is [[PCs/Mallory\|Mallory]], the bard. With Mallory's scarlet eyes looks at Thorm and greets him, telling him about the wonders and happiness of life. As they talk about pies, the contest gets ready to commence. The owner announces the beginning of the contest, gathering a large crowd. Within the crowd, trapped, are Aurelius and Kyocera, being forced to watch.

*(contest - constitution roll off)*
Mallory - Thorm )
1st (19 - 20) Thorm
2nd (7 - 5) Mallory
3rd (14 - 7) Mallory
4th (6 - 11) Thorm
5th (7 - 9) Thorm

The contest ends with crowds cheering, Thorm is the winner, and Mallory throws up to the side.

*(constitution roll 13)* Mallory stops throwing up with little side effects.

The store owner hands Thorm 10gp of his winnings. Thorm offers Mallory half of his winnings, but Mallory declines, after hesitation instead takes 3gp.

Kyocera looks around as the crowd disperses, and it seems that he is in a square, and tries to find an alleyway to run into. While running to the alley, he finds a potato sack; ripping holes, he creates a shirt and pants.

Suddenly, a scream tears through the market, and panicked crowds run and push against you. You are all confused, hearing low-toned growls and the shouting of a young woman. Thorm, Mallory and Aurelius try to go closer towards the sound, finding a stall to hide in.

*(investigation roll of 11)* Aurelius tries finding a stall that looks most valuable, which he finds is a jewellery store with strings of bangles hanging from the stall, boxes filled with necklaces and rings are lined neatly on the table.

Aurelius grabs one ring and a necklace from the jewellery stall and hides in the stall opposite which is an apple stall, and peers down all the stalls to see; a large black writhing mass of flesh, sharp spines running down its back, standing on its four legs, it turns around to reveal a maw with lines of sharp teeth and two big bulbous black eyes on either side. Under it, what appears to be a young woman with flesh across the pavement, lying in a pool of blood.

Mallory yells, "Hey!" at the monster, causing it to turn and look at Mallory.

*(insight roll 11)* Mallory tries to make out if the monster reacted more to her sound or her words, to which she thinks her sound.

*(Mallory casts command stay on the monster, to which it had no effect/monster got beat DC)*

The monster lets out a roar, and all party members fall to their knees, visions of death, fire and destruction, the same as the ones in your dreams fill your head. The creature starts coming towards the party members.

**COMBAT**
Initiative: Aurelius (20), Mallory (19), Mawling (15), Thorm (13), Kyocera (2)

*Aurelius*
runs to the next stall closer to the Mawling and casts Eldritch Blast on it.
(fails hit on 6)
The monster turns his focus towards Aurelius.

*Mallory*
goes towards the Mawling, preparing to stab it with her rapier.
(hits on 13, dealing 7 piercing damage)
Mallory runs to it, keeping close to the ground, piercing it in between its eyes, its focus now fixed on back on Mallory.

*Mawling*
The Mawling goes to bite Mallory
(hits on 18, dealing 3 slashing damage)
Its teeth are digging in, taking a tiny chunk of her shoulder.

*Thorm*
He casts an entangle on the Mawling.
(Mawling wins strength check of 15)

*Kyocera*
moves to the nearest stall, right next to Aurelius. He tries to pick the stall up to throw at the Mawling.
(fails on roll of 10)
The stall fails to budge, so he moves to Aurelius and tells him that they must help one another and that there is no other option. They have a squabble, being eavesdropped on by Thorm, ending with Aurelius saying "Watch me", while also hearing guards approach in the background shouting "DON'T WORRY CIVILIANS< WE ARE COMING"

*Aurelius*
Aurelius casts Eldritch Blast, saying, "Watch this, Goliath"
(hits on 18, dealing 9 damage)
He turns around, peering over the stall, screaming Eldritch blast, a crackling bolt of purple strikes down at the Mawling, taking a large chunk of his flesh, turning around, facing Aurelius.
"I wasn't able to kill it; perhaps you can show me how it's done"

*Mallory*
He calls out to Aurelius, "Thank you", and goes for another stab at the monster.
(hits on 20, dealing critical 10 piercing damage)
As he grasps her shoulder, looking at the beast as it turns away to Aurelius, she hits her foot against the concrete, launching herself as high as she can atop the beast, brandishing her rapier, striking down with all her muster where she thinks the brain would be. The rapier pierces through its skull, appearing in its mouth, it gargles and disintegrates into black dust.

**END COMBAT**

Thorm runs over and collects some dust into a vial. In the rest of the dust pile, you all see a black [[obsidian orb\|obsidian orb]], about the size of a grapefruit. While Kyocera starts preparing to run back to his cell to retrieve his equipment.

*(Mallory's wisdom saving throw rolls 20)* Mallory gestures to Aurelius and Thorm that the orb stays between them. 

As Mallory picks up the orb, the whole parties feel a throbbing sensation over all their bodies, a whisper fills their ears, "Seek the stone face beneath the earth... the watchful will open" Visions flash through their minds, ruins covered in vines, in what seems to be a clearing surrounded by trees. Murals are etched on the walls as your mind ventures deeper within, old armour pieces line the ground like the outcome of some conflict. As you wake back to reality, you feel a burning sensation go across your neck, like a hot knife. The [[obsidian orb\|obsidian orb]] that was in your hand now turned to stone.
*(d6 average roll 2.5 takes 3 damage)*

*(Thorm history roll 12)* Thorm recognises that the ruins' architecture looks old and appears to be similar to some of the ruins and towers around [[Locations/Regions/Baufendom\|Baufendom]], like the ruins around [[Locations/Cities and Villages/Brindlebrook\|Brindlebrook]]. 

You see a black tattoo-like mark where you felt the burning sensation.

*(Aurelius investigation roll 5)* He doesn't recognise the tattoo's origin.

Mallory is wheezing from the exhaustion of battle, and Kyocera is panicking and flustered, attempting to rip the tattoo off his skin.

*(Kyocera takes 2 damage)* The tattoo is unable to come off.

A group of 8 guards head towards the party, and Mallory rips a piece of fabric covering the scar. Two guards try to drag Kyocera.

*(Kyocera strength nat 20)* Kyocera smashes their head together and takes one of the guards' long swords and armour.

The rest of the 6 guards surround Kyocera, shouting, "PUT THE WEAPON DOWN OR WE WILL HAVE YOU DETAINED!"

(Mallory casts Bardic Inspiration on Kyocera)
(Kyocera persuasion roll 18) "Help! Help! I need to find the killers who killed my family. I don't know where I am, help me" In response, "Okay, okay, but sir, you must lower your weapon". Kyocera asks who they are, and they tell him that they are the town guards of [[Locations/Cities and Villages/Brindlebrook\|Brindlebrook]]. "What is Brindlebrook?" "The city that you are in? Sir, if you don't drop your weapon now in the next five seconds, we will have to detain you". 
Mallory limps towards the guards with a fake limp, "Please, there is no need for this. This fine man right here helped dissuade the beast that just ravaged these people, helped to suade and vanquish said beast."

*(Persuasion roll of 17)* They let their guards down, "right, please come with me". They start guiding Mallory and Kyocera towards the other two party members.

With the guards, among them there is also an old man, hunched with long white hair and beard. His steps, assisted by a cane. Kyocera asks him, "Why are you small?" "Please do not use that tone with me". Kyocera then asks if the old man knows what he is and if he's seen his kind. In response, the old man tells him that he has not in a long time, then tells Kyocera to lower his weapon, which he does. The old man looks up at him and is shocked, almost horrified and asks Where did you get the black scar from. 

*(Mallory casts cure wounds to heal 8)*

The old man tells them to please leave the town. You then hear a horse galloping in the background, a man in silver armour, golden, luscious hair, chiselled face with a sword on his hilt, comes riding in. The old man says, "Oh, Captain Vey, you have arrived. Please help escort these travellers out of town," Mallory asks the old man why he is so knowledgeable in this. The old man tells her that he thinks it's a curse and a bad omen; he's read it in books and pleads with you again to leave the town, or he'll have the guards escort you. Aurelius then says he will leave at an expense, "maybe 20gp?" Kyocera is not happy and asks him why he is bullying an old man, and pushes Aurelius.

*(Kyocera rolls Accuracy 18, Aurelius Dexterity 8)*
*(Aurelius takes 3 damage)*

Kyocera and Aurelius start beefing while Mallory tries to diffuse the situation. Kyocera tries to run to where he was kept prisoner, being stopped by [[Captain Vey\|Captain Vey]]. Mallory tries diffusing, but gets spoken over by Kyocera, "I need my stuff, let me go"

*(intimidation rolls 10)*

Captain Vey sees Kyocera's attempt at intimidation and tells him that he will detain him if he keeps being aggressive. Kyocera rips off his shirt, revealing all his lacerations and scars around his body "You expect me to go on with nothing?"

*(persuasion rolls 9)*

[[Captain Vey\|Captain Vey]] is not convinced by his scars and tells him that he must leave because "What is coming will arrive". After a bit of back and forth, [[Captain Vey\|Captain Vey]] understands that you all helped kill the beast and allows you to stay the night until daybreak. Kyocera asks him where the slave traders are, and Captain Vey has no idea. Kyocera then goes on to tell him that his kind pillaged his village. Aurelius tries to de-escalate the conversation, "SILENCE TIEFLING" Aurelius suggests the two duel, which Vey agrees.

*(Mallory performance roll 6)* Mallory tries to blow on her flute, but no sound comes out

*(Thorm casts Thurmaturgy to make rabbit sounds appear)* Vey asks what the origin of the noise was.

*(Mallory casts prestidigitation to make Veys' armour close)* Vey looks at Mallory, drawing his sword, pointing it at Mallory, "Stop that now"

(Mallory deception roll 13) Vey puts his sword back into his scabbard.

Kyocera and Vey go back to their spat, as Aurelius walks away. Vey says, "Goliath, you should follow your friend", to which Aurelius responds ", He's not a friend, more of a pest". Kyocera follows Aurelius. Thorm starts leaving towards their direction.
Aurelius questions Kyocera about him being a slave. Kyocera then retorts that Aurelius is a crook. Then they make their way to where Kyocera was held captive, arguing with each other, resulting in Kyocera telling Aurelius that he should leave him. Aurelius says, "Go on and get your stuff if you want; it doesn't matter to me what outcome happens to you"

Mallory starts walking towards Kyocera and Aurelius. Vey says to Mallory, "Bard, do not follow these three, they bring a bad omen" Mallory takes off the cloth, revealing the mark "I think you'll find I am with these three" "All four of you be careful, a storm is coming", and he gallops away.

Kyocera goes into the building to find his equipment.

*(investigation roll 11)* Kyocera finds a large chest under a table

*(strength roll 9)* Kyocera tries ripping open the chest, but it doesn't open

*(Mallory strength roll 17)* Mallory comes to help Kyocera and jams her rapier in between the crack of the chest and tries prying it open. As he does, the latch keeping the chest closed flings open, followed by the lid of the chest.

Kyocera collects all his belongings along with *(1x health potion, 3gp)*, "I didn't need your help, bard". Aurelius then bumps into Kyocera to try to steal his gold.

*(Kyocera perception roll 5)*
*(Aurelius sleight of hand roll 4)*

Kyocera notices and grabs Aurelius by the neck and grips. "Any last words, Tiefling?"
Aurelius says he knows where the rest of his kind is.

*(Kyocera intimidation roll 17)*
*(Aurelius wisdom roll 9)*

Aurelius is scared shitless, Kyocera asks where his kind is, and Aurelius points to Batalan Plateau.

*(Kyocera intimidation roll 13)*
*(Aurelius wisdom roll 19)*

Aurelius says, "In the misty mountains of Batalan Plateau is where your kind is". Kyocera drops him and says, "You better be telling the truth, Tiefling".

Thorm and Mallory start conversing, and Mallory says some koo koo hippie shit.

Kyocera asks the group if everyone would like to go to a cartography store, "map store", Mallory and Thorm say no need and present him the map. Kyocera says he can't read the language but can only speak. Kyocera asks about the wisp, and Mallory starts saying Koo Koo life death stuff again.

Aurelius tells the party that they should rest and carry on their journey tomorrow, and remarks that Kyocera is a mentally unstable creature.

*(Kyocera slight of hand roll 15)*
*(Aurelius constitution roll 4)*

Kyocera shines light into Aurelius's eyes with his sword and tells him to speak carefully, and Aurelius responds, "Maybe we got off on the wrong foot, we both can help each other out, I could guide you to your people, and you could help me with my endeavours" Kyocera reaches out for a handshake and say "if you give me 10gp"

*(Kyocera slight of hand roll 5)*
*(Aurelius constitution roll 13)*

Aurelius slaps his hand out of the way and says, "Don't get all willy nilly with me" They then decide to lie down in the cell and take a rest and try to sleep.

Mallory tells Aurelius and Kyocera that they will meet them at the gates at sunrise. Thorm and Mallory decide to go find an inn. They look outside down the street and see buildings of all sorts, there: Blackthorne Forge, Violet Vial, Marrow and Flint's General Goods, down by the riverside, is a dock with fishermen sitting on barrels. They then come across two larger buildings opposite of other, one has a sign reading Adventurer's Guild and one has an insignia of two crossed swords. Further down, they see The Lucky Loughman going inside. They discover a tavern filled with people drinking, they overhear shop owners talking about closed-off trading routes, they overhear two people in hooded robes, "What are we going to do?", they see a group of what looks to be people in armour sitting at the back. All around, most people look to be still shaken up over the events that happened today, but the rest are cheering and having a good time. In front of you is the counter of a bar, behind it a barista, polishing his equipment. 
Thorm asks the barkeep if he has any beans. After conversing with the chef in the back room, he says they have 5 kilograms of black beans, which Thorm takes the lot for 7gp, overpaying by 2gp. The barkeep pours Mallory a mug of Brindlebrook's famous apple cider and gives them both two room keys. Mallory tries offering Thorm 2gp, which is declined by him.

*(Mallory's sleight of hand roll 3)* Mallory tries to sneak the 2gp in his pocket, but he notices
*(Thorm's sleight of hand roll 20)* Thorm sneaks it back into Mallory's pocket

Kyocera and Aurelius both pretend they are sleeping. Kyocera mutters to himself, "I will not sleep next to any Tiefling" Kyocera scurries out to explore the nightly streets of [[Locations/Cities and Villages/Brindlebrook\|Brindlebrook]], Aurelius still pretending to sleep. Kyocera goes to an alleyway, picks up garments from a washing line and puts them on, fitting tightly over his large body. He then walks into the nearest building. Inside is a well-lit hall, with long lines of tables, stairs leading up to a mezzanine and a balcony overlooking the first floor. In front is a counter, behind it a man in nice clothing.

*(History roll 17)* He notices that it is a uniform

Kyocera asks the man if he could direct him to the questlogs. But the man behind the counter tells him that they are only for his members. As this is happening, Aurelius decides to go out of the cell to try to find Kyocera.

*(Aurelius investigation roll 10)* Aurelius makes out some vague big footprints going down the street, and he decides to follow them.

Aurelius decides to enter the [[Locations/Places/Brindlebrook/Violet Vial\|Violet Vial]], which is a flower shop and sees a young woman pruning roses amongst the shelves of flowers and bouquets. He asks the lady if he could purchase some flowers for his 'lover' and tries to bargain with her for a bouquet of dahlias, lowering the price to two gold pieces. He learns that she's having a hard time getting her orders shipped and receiving supplies due to the trade routes being blocked off for some reason.

*(Aurelius casts distort value)* Aurelius makes the flowers have an illusion that they look damaged to try to bargain with her. She decides to lower her price, but Aurelius feels bad and gives her two gp. As Aurelius is walking out, he sees Thorm walking into the flower shop and has a small exchange. Thorm goes into the flower shop and decides to browse the flowers. 
Kyocera walks out of the Adventurers' Guild after not being able to get quests from the [[Locations/Places/Adventurers’ Guild\|Adventurers’ Guild]]. Going towards the area with the most noise, he finds himself in the [[Lucky Loughman\|Lucky Loughman]].

*(perception roll 12)* He spots guards in the back, drinking and laughing.

Kyocera approaches the guards and is met with hostility. While this is happening, Aurelius walks into the building and watches this unfold. Kyocera is met with more hostility, and Aurelius finally comes to de-escalate the situation.

*(Aurelius persuasion 17)* Aurelius tells the guards to calm down on not disobey what [[Captain Vey\|Captain Vey]] had said, which is that they can stay a night. making the guards more passive and go back in their chairs.

Kyocera and Aurelius try bribing with two gold coins, but the guards don't accept. Kyocera says that it is not a bribe and that he is just treating them to drinks. Kyocera asks about how many non-humans are in this town. He then learns that there are multiple races since this is a crossroads between trading routes. Aurelius asks about lief and the merchants of Northwick, but the guards are unknowing. Kyocera asks about the human trafficking side, again with unknowing answers, but the guard tells them people have often gone missing when travelling out in the woodlands near. The guard refuses to answer more questions and turns away.
Aurelius and Kyocera walk out of the bar. Aurelius tells Kyocera that they should reconcile and offers him the flowers he bought, but they are drishriven. They remind Kyocera of his past, and how the flowers and flora were destroyed by raiders. Kyocera then slaps the flowers out of Aurelius's hand and tells him not to remind him of his past. Aurelius picks up the flowers and says, "You don't know my past, and I don't know yours. How about we go back to the cell and get a good night's rest?" They walk to the cell and start to fall asleep. Thorm also goes back to the inn to sleep. You all then have dreams, the same ones you've been having.
