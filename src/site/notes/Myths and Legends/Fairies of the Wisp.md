Have you ever heard of the fairies in the Wisp?” the elder whispered, leaning closer to the fire. The flames danced in their eyes as the children huddled around. “Long ago, a curious child wandered too far into the forest. It was the Night of the Silver Bloom, when a rare flower blossoms only once every hundred years.

The child stumbled upon a circle of fairies, their lights twinkling like stars, dancing around that silver flower. They warned him, ‘Do not touch it, or you will forget the world you know.’ But the child’s curiosity was too strong. He reached out… and just like that, he vanished.

The forest around him changed. Paths twisted, trees grew taller than mountains, and shadows moved as if alive. Some say the fairies took him as punishment, others say he became part of the Wisp itself.

So remember, children,” the elder said, poking the fire, “if you ever wander into the Wisp, tread lightly. Watch the lights, listen to the whispers… and never, ever touch what is not yours. The fairies are always watching, and they never forget.
