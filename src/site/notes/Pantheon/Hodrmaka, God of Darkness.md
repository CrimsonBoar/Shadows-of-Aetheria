### Lore

Hodrmaka is widely feared rather than worshipped. He is not wholly evil; shadows conceal, protect, and give rest. But he is known for his trickster-like behaviour, and his power can devour the light.

### Folklore

- **The Whispers:** Many people claim to hear Hodrmaka whisper in their ears when walking alone at night.
